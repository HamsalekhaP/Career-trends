# Where It Pays To Attend College?

Team Vis-Ã -Vis- Cheng Li, Hamsalekha Premkumar, Sreeranjani Didugu

A good college is synonymous with quality education and holistic development in students. Some key factors that influence aspiring college students in choosing a college are reputation of the college, availability of desired program, academic quality, job opportunities, career outcome, increase in earning power, etc. An interesting question to ask is if the differences in college, major and region are statistically significant. 
In this study, we aim to analyse a dataset curated by Wall Street Journal based on a survey conducted by PayScale Inc. and present an interactive narrative visualization. It consists of a comprehensive list of colleges and universities in the US with salaries at different stages of career for different undergraduate majors, colleges, college types and regions. We hope to identify trends in the dataset pertaining to salaries in different majors, colleges and regions.
